# difference between  discrete and continious ROC

Recently, when I check the [FDDB dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/) evaluation Result,I found out I don't
understand the two evaluation standard: Discrete ROC and Continious ROC.

What do they mean ? And what is the difference?

I got my answers from [FDDB Techinal Report](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/fddb.pdf).
